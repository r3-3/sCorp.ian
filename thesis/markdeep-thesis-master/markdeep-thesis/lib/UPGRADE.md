* Add support (and maybe an example in the demo) for any newly added constructs.
* Get the new `relativize.css` from [here](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-relative-sizes).
* Update the include path at the bottom of the demo to match the new version.
* Update the include path in the `applyStyles` function of `../markdeep-thesis.js` to match the new version.


## Bindery

* Download new versions of the required files from [here](https://unpkg.com/browse/bindery@2.2.9/dist/).
* Check if anything breaks (*especially* in the printed PDF).
